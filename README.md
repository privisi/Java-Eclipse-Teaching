# Java-Eclipse-Teaching

Exercises for this week:

### Using the code we used to shoot towards the mouse:

**1. Make enemies spawn moving in random directions**

**2. Make enemies shoot in random directions**

--------------------

**1. Make a menu where you can click start to begin the game, or exit**

**2. Create an explosive enemy that when killed, explodes into several large balls that dissapear after a second**

You can be creative with this one

### Challenging (don't have to do in order)

**1. Have random enemies spawn in from the top of the screen (Outside the window), this is hard because the enemies must enter from outside the window (y < 0) and not bounce, and then start bouncing when they are inside**

The enemies shoud be able to spawn anywhere from the top of the screen (not just the top left corner)

Hint - don't let the balls bounce when they are y > 0 until they first enter the visible area. (Remember how our coordinate system starts at 0,0 (Top left) and goes to 600,600 (bottom right) but stuff can be outside of the screen).

**2. Give your player health, so that they may receive multiple attacks from enemies and survive, and display the health via a red health bar somewhere.**

Instead of displaying your health as a number, do it via a red health bar, something like [this](https://as3gametuts.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/picture-18.png?w=640)

**3. Create a crosshair (Something that follows the mouse)**
Try to get it to replace your cursor so that it looks something like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Crosshairs_Red.svg/1200px-Crosshairs_Red.svg.png)
