Exercises for this week:

1. Change the game we made this week

2. Write a program that fills an array

  int[] minusNumbers = new int[1000]
  Use a for loop to fill the array from 1000 to 1
  For example
  minusNumbers[0] = 1000
  minusNumbers[1] = 999
  ...
  minusNumbers[998] = 2
  minusNumbers[999] = 1
  
Bonus challenge:
3. Write a program that fills an array

   int[][] grid = new int[10][10]
   The numbers in grid should be 0 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 29 ... 90 to 99
   For example
   grid[2][2] = 22
   grid[4][7] = 47
   grid[0][3] = 3
   grid[0][0] = 0
   grid[9][9] = 99
   ...
   (hint: for-loops can go into for-loops!)
