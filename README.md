# Java-Eclipse-Teaching

Exercises for this week:

### 1. Re-implement all of shooter so that it is clean. Try to delegate / move functionality into other classes rather than doing everything in shooter.java

**2. Create a save key in the that when pressed, saves some state of the game**

You don't have to save everything, just save what seems to be sensible.

**3. Implement some sounds for your game**

**4. Implement a boss with a lot of health.**

This boss should get smaller as its health goes down. It should also spawn enemies as it's health goes down. You should spawn stronger enemies as the bosses health gets lower. The enemies should spawn underneath the boss somewhere.

**5. As the player levels up, they should shoot multiple bullets.**

**6. Create an enemy that shoots at the player every 0.5 - 2 seconds.**

**7. Create an enemy that shoots a ring of bullets (a bullet every 30 degrees etc. making a ring formation)**

[Something like this for example](https://www.libertygames.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/shhot-em-up-history.jpg)

### Challenging (don't have to do in order)**

**1. Make a pause screen, when you press ESC. it should pause the game until you click resume again.**

**2. Create a circle wall.

Make this wall black and spawn a few around the level randomly. The player should not be able to pass through this wall.
