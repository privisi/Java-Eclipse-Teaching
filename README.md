### Homework
1. Finish the node path script. It should allow you to place any amount of nodes in an array, then the enemy should follow the node path in order and loop when it reaches the end.

2. Spawner script. You should be able to place two child gameobjects within a gameobject with the spawner script at (top-left-corner) and (bottom-right-corner) which will form a rectangle. You should be able to put an enemy prefab that then spawns occassionally in the rectangular spawn area. The enemy should only spawn in that rectangle formed by the 2 child gameobjects, and moving the child game objects around should also change the area (rectangle) that the enemies can spawn in


#### UI

1. Create a title screen with working play and quit buttons.
2. Create a pause screen when you press esc (look into Time.timeScale). It should have a button to resume or return to main menu.
3. Create some other UI such as a fire timer bar, score etc.
