### Homework
Fix whatever is broken here:

4. Create a pathing script that you attach onto an enemy that makes them move randomly around the screen


#### UI

1. Create a title screen with working play and quit buttons.
2. Create a pause screen when you press esc (look into Time.timeScale). It should have a button to resume or return to main menu.
3. Create some other UI such as a fire timer bar, score etc.
