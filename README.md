# Java-Eclipse-Teaching

Exercises for this week:

### 1. Finish off your shooter game

**3. Implement a boss with a lot of health.**

This boss should get smaller as its health goes down. It should also spawn enemies as it's health goes down. You should spawn stronger enemies as the bosses health gets lower. The enemies should spawn underneath the boss somewhere.

**4. As the player levels up, they should shoot multiple bullets.**

[Something like this for example](https://www.libertygames.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/shhot-em-up-history.jpg)

**5. Create an enemy that shoots !directly! at the player every 0.5 - 2 seconds.**

**6. Create an enemy that shoots a ring of bullets (a bullet every 30 degrees etc. making a ring formation)**

**6. Create some walls which enemies and bullets also react to**

etc. bullet deletion, enemy bounce.

**7 Introduce randomness into the enemies movements**

### Challenging (don't have to do in order)**

**1. Use the robot class to keep the mouse in the screen**

Everytime the mouse is moved, you should reset the mouse position back into the middle of the window. You should create,use and update a local MouseX and MouseY variable to simulate where your mouse is inside your jframe and use that for all mouse operations (ignoring where the actual mouse is).
