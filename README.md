You can access everything we've done in the *src* folder

Exercises for this week:

1. Change the game we made this week.

2. Write a program that fills an array.

```
  int[][] multiples = new int[10][10]
  Use a for loop to fill the array from 1000 to 1
  For example
  multiples[0][0] = 0         // 0 x 0
  multiples[1][1] = 1         // 1 * 1
  multiples[2][6] = 12        // 2 * 6
  ...
  multiples[5][5] = 25        // 5 * 5
  multiples[9][9] = 81        // 9 * 9
```
Bonus challenge:
3. Write a program that fills an array.

```
   int[][] grid = new int[10][10]
   The numbers in grid should be 0 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 29 ... 90 to 99
   For example
   grid[2][2] = 22
   grid[4][7] = 47
   grid[0][3] = 3
   grid[0][0] = 0
   grid[9][9] = 99
   ...
   (hint: for-loops can go into for-loops!)
 ```
