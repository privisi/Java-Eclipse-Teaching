When you click the mouse, it should create / draw a circle where you clicked.

Bonus: make a second view that has a button to erase what you drew, and also circle settings such as size, colour etc/

**Hard**

**3. Create a program that places 5 - 10 circles randomly.** <br/>
The color and size are up to you but should be sensible.<br/>
These circles should all move in random directions and when they hit the edge of the window, they should bounce.
